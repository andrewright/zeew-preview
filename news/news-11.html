        <p class="card-text">Zeew started in November 2016 from an idea of the CEO &amp; Founder Mohamed Ghaith, who pondered over how delivery times often took too long and kept putting him off purchasing certain products online. Certain that there could be a better way to have businesses improve on those delays and be more efficient with deliveries, he started planning this innovative on-demand delivery service that is bound to revolutionise how we see the delivery industry today.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In January 2017 a team was formed to work on this initial idea, combining expertise in business, finance, software engineering and development, marketing, communication and web development. A mixture of knowledge and experience that put together could efficiently develop a new transformation of how businesses are used to shipping items. Bringing the latest innovations in Artificial Intelligence driven chat-bot technology to the table, alongside deliveries operated by drone and robots with the current Zeew&rsquo;s infrastructure. Our company works based on what the latest technology has to offer and seizes these newest means of combining services we&rsquo;ve always used alongside modern ways to approach them. That&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t shy away from using blockchain technology and smart contracts, knowing that it would lead to the ultimate modern on-demand delivery service we can offer, cutting away any of the business inefficiencies that have happened over the years.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The on-demand economy is ready to take over, and has already done so in other industries such as transportation with Uber, so we can see a potential huge market within the delivery industry who has already made huge losses of income to businesses due to losing parcels and theft. The FBI estimates that cargo theft is losing a rising $30 billion per year within the United States alone, as such the need for a change in the way we approach deliveries is hugely important.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In September 2017 we gained funding by winning the LatBAN pitch competition, MITA Malta Innovation grant, Startupwiseguys Investment, WeXelerate batch II in Vienna and opened offices in Malta and Latvia. From there, we worked on our initial launch which started in mid November of the same year, using those 3 months in between to understand better how much potential our project can have, learning of the possibility of it disrupting the $215 billion on-demand Delivery industry.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In February 2018 we integrate blockchain to our services and follow the lead of experts in the field, then leading us to the launch of an ICO campaign that will run from April until August, all while we keep working on delivering the most efficient solution to the delivery needs that businesses have been facing everyday.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We are pleased to see the benefits that the 58 businesses that are already using Zeew have been enjoying, and with the funds raised via the ICO campaign we aim to provide this same level of efficient services to more countries and businesses all over the world. We started with a pre-sale that quickly sold out of its 1,000,000 tokens, and we are now about to go into the other rounds of our ICO campaign.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Supporting us is as quick as purchasing these tokens with a click, all you need is an Ethereum wallet, and the earliest you do it the better bonus you receive. Our next round starts on the 14th of May and lasts until the 27th of May, offering you a 45% bonus of any of the 1,600,000 Zeew tokens we offer on this round. The one after that will offer a 36% bonus, then 28%, until it drops to 2% on our final round during the period of August.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Currently 1 Zeew Token is the equivalent of 1 USD, while 1 ETH is the equivalent of 675 ZEEW. Whatever is your choice of methods of purchase for the tokens, just know that they are limited to 20,483,871 and that there won&rsquo;t be any additional token released later on. This is your only chance to not only support the expansion of an idea that will help you and your business, but to also receive benefits and rewards through it thanks to the 8% token rewards you receive if you share the referral link with your friends and family.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Don&rsquo;t miss out on the chance to help us develop the ultimate tool that will definitely change the way we choose, order and deliver goods for every business who wishes to upgrade from outdated means of delivery. Instead of waiting for the industry to change, let&rsquo;s work on bringing this new vision into reality right now.</p>
