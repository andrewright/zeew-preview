        <p class="card-text">Zeew is proudly selected for Malta Information Technology Agency program for the duration of 4 month,</p>

        <p class="card-text">In November 2017 the MITA Innovation Hub, a spin-off team focusing on accelerating entrepreneurs with a digital idea, launched the third edition of the YouStartIT acceleration programme. The process is competitive, and only the best ideas and teams are chosen.</p>

        <p class="card-text">By the 28 January deadline, 94 applications applied from 19 countries, 45 per cent of which from Malta. From these 13 teams were shortlisted and invited to participate in a short pre-acceleration phase: six teams from Malta and seven teams from Italy, the Netherlands, Libya, Latvia, Poland the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

        <p class="card-text">This phase consisted of an extended week-long bootcamp to allow the startups to pitch their idea, receive feedback and take it on board; come up to speed about legal requirements to set themselves up as a business; and then engage in one-to-one meetings to allow the MIH team to acquire deeper insights and challenge the teams. The foreign teams participated via video conferencing equipment. Angelika Lattner, an experienced startup coach from Stuttgart, Germany, participated in the bootcamp.</p>

        <p class="card-text">On Saturday 24 February all 13 startups pitched their idea before a panel of judges with different levels of involvement: Alex Borg, the manager of the MIH, Bonavent Gauci, a partner at PwC, and Jessica Gioglio, a London-based writer, speaker and marketing strategist, brought here specially for the occasion.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Eight startups were selected and Zeew was one of them.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Zeew team will be spending the coming 4 months between Riga, Latvia and Malta as preparation for Main ICO</p>
