        <p class="card-text">Save Your Keystore&nbsp;File</p>

        <p class="card-text">Next you will be offered to download Keystore File. This file should be secured. If you will loose or someone will stole this file you may loose all your funds stored on this address. Be aware of malicious/phishing sites, never share this file with anyone. Do not keep it on Google Drive or Dropbox or whatever.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><img class="card-img" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*W92miKv1RAGNLQldxJ8XHg.png" /></p>

        <p class="card-text">Your Private&nbsp;Key</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is the most important step. You will get Private Key for your address. It will be used to access your Ethereum Address, wether it will be online or from any kind of other wallet software. If you will loose this key, it can&rsquo;t be recovered. You can print it and keep it in, for example, in bank deposit box, where your real values are kept. We keep our keys in&nbsp;<a href="https://lastpass.com/f?56691778" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lastpass.com</a>.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Never, never make photo of this screen with your phone, never take screenshots nor send this Private Key by email, messenger or sms.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><img class="card-img" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sdNUKaQ-gGjy97j6L2mkZQ.png" /></p>

        <p class="card-text">Your wallet&nbsp;info</p>

        <p class="card-text">Now when you have Ethereum Address and Private Key you can access your Address Info. Select View Wallet Info from top o–∞ page, choose access method as Private Key and type your key from last step to red box. If Private Key was entered correctly the box will turn green.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Another word of warning! Check URL and SSL connection twice before entering Private Key. Also try not to enter Private Keys on untrusted devices</p>

        <p class="card-text"><img class="card-img" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e7WQU1SV8bFS1q2tIKNaTw.png" /></p>

        <p class="card-text">Your Ethereum&nbsp;Address</p>

        <p class="card-text">As well if you purchase&nbsp;<a href="http://wallet.zeew.eu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ZEEW Tokens</a>&nbsp;using this address then ZEEW tokens will be transferred to this wallet automatically by the smart contract.</p>
