        <p class="card-text">Dear early investors,</p>

        <p class="card-text">First of all we would like to thank you for your interest in our pre-ico, Thank you.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We have received over 1,000 investors and gave top class support as much we we can to the community, immediately after our pre-ico campaign we started sending tokens manually for those who participated before we deploy the smart contract (which allows automatic transfer of tokens after the purchase).</p>

        <p class="card-text">The problem is we received huge pressure through our communication channels either through live chat or Telegram group which lead us to rush and do mistakes with the transfer which lead us to lose over 5,000 ZEEW by mistakingly transferring twice tokens to same investor.</p>

        <h3>Why do you need ZEEW token before the ICO&nbsp;ENDS?</h3>

        <p class="card-text">well, the answer is: you do not need ZEEW token before our ICO ends, it simply has no value, it is non-transferable, you cannot trade it or do anything with it until we hit the exchange which is about +1month from now.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We have tried expanding our team but we simply cannot look for new team members, give them training while at same time we get 100 requests per day asking about tokens and pressuring us.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We planning our ICO itself in about 3 weeks time, and that is huge amount of work that we need to do, we need to develop the back-end cabinet for investors, new ICO website, promo videos, marketing, community managers &amp; more; we are humans and we need time to do things right.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We have already gave tokens to 50% of early investors, now we will focus on preparation for the ICO itself which will happen in about 3 weeks, then we will be sending tokens to all investors who have not received ZEEW tokens yet (only which participated in early stages) all investors that are going to participate in ICO itself, will be getting ZEEW tokens instantly after the purchase (automatically) by smart contract.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We would like to thank you for your understanding.</p>
