        <h3>How to Support Zeew</h3>
        <div class="card-subtitle">

        <p class="card-text">Zeew is the latest way of thinking about shipping orders and delivering goods, offering on-demand delivery to businesses in a quick and efficient way never seen before. As such, we are based on an original idea that has already been proved to be successful and that plans on expanding and growing even bigger.</p>

        <p class="card-text">We can&rsquo;t do this without the support of everyone who knows how helpful this service would be for their everyday business work, and as such we are running an ICO to help us reach more funds that will help us turn ZEEW into the go-to of delivery systems for the future. Already it&rsquo;s been used by 58 businesses on a daily basis, and the ease and convenience of it is the main reason those companies are already benefiting from it. As anyone can use their own car, scooter or even bike to deliver packages and make money.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Our goal</p>

        <p class="card-text">The money raised will go into different ventures that we aim to work on to provide the ultimate on-demand delivery service that every business will want to start using. 50% of it all will be used on expansion, meaning that we&rsquo;ll work to go beyond our offices in Malta and Latvia, planning to grow bigger and provide this service to other 14 countries over the next few years. Soon everyone will be able to benefit from it. 15% will go to marketing and PR, as we work on spreading the word about it and informing more business about this amazing opportunity to do work at a faster and more efficient level. 20% will go into research and development, as we don&rsquo;t aim to stop any time soon and are always on the lookout to find better ways to improve and providing the best delivery service possible. The last 15% will then go technology and logistics, aiming to give everyone a bug free platform that won&rsquo;t be brought down at the first technological glitch, and planning to provide a quick and easy solution that anyone can access.</p>

        <p class="card-text">How does it work?</p>

        <p class="card-text">The ZEEW Tokens are always released by smart contract and are compatible with any of your ERC20 Ethereum Wallets, as they are released they will be sent to the Ethereum address you insert. You have to make sure that you possess a valid ERC20 compatible Ethereum address to finally receive your tokens. Wallets such as MyEtherWaller, MetaMask, Mist and Tokenlot are all compatible and can be used for this transaction.</p>

        <p class="card-text">You can alternative also use your ETH, BTC or LTC from any exchange or wallet to purchase tokens and soon you will also have the option to pay by credit card. Just make sure that you don&rsquo;t send them directly from any exchange addresses or you&rsquo;re at risk of losing your tokens. Choose other payment methods available to send from exchange if you wish to do so.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The ZEEW platform will offer 12.000.000 ZEEW Tokens during public ICO Campaign<br />
            out of 20,483,871, and all the tokens not sold during the ICO Campaign will then be destroyed. The price for 1 ZEEW Token corresponds to 1 USD and will increase over the 4 rounds that run from May until the end of August. We have no plans to emit additional tokens so make sure to get there early to not be disappointed and miss out.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Rewards</p>

        <p class="card-text">Buying tokens isn&rsquo;t the only way you get extra tokens to your wallet, we have created a system that helps support us while you get rewarded. You can gain 8% ZEEW tokens your friends have bought once you share your own personalized ZEEW referral link to your friends. Spreading the word around has never been more advantageous and easy, as you can easily share your link in person, via social media, messaging services, emails or any other way you wish to communicate (except for trademark PPC bidding).</p>

        <p class="card-text">Don&rsquo;t miss out on joining us as we work on building this revolutionary delivery service, the support for it has already been amazing and it&rsquo;s positive this is an investment that will reward you back. The pre-sale has sold out of the initial 1,000,000 tokens, and we are about to start with the next rounds of sales that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on. Get there early to get advantages thanks to the bigger bonuses, starting with 45% on our first round that lasts until the 27th of May.</p>

        <p class="card-text">This is your chance to bring your business to the next level by leaving behind the outdated methods of delivery and enjoying a much more straightforward and quick approach to what&rsquo;s been a source of problems for many years until now.</p>
