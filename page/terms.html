            <h2>6. Risks</h2>

            <p>6.1. You understand that crypto currency, ZEEW Tokens, blockchain technology, Ethereum, Ether and other associated and related technologies are new and relatively untested and outside of <strong>ZEEW&rsquo;s</strong> exclusive control and any adverse changes in market forces or the technology impacting <strong>ZEEW&rsquo;s</strong> performance under this Agreement shall absolve <strong>ZEEW</strong> from responsibility over any delayed or unachieved milestones.</p>

            <p>6.2. In addition to the above, you also acknowledge that you have been warned of the following risks, associated with the Website, the crypto currency, the ZEEW Tokens and other relevant technologies mentioned herein, and that you absolve <strong>ZEEW</strong> from any and all responsibility on any damages occurring in light of the risks listed below:</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">a) Legal risks regarding securities regulations<br />
                <br />
                There is a risk that in some jurisdictions the ZEEW Tokens or other crypto currency might be considered to be a security, or that it might be considered to be a security in the future. <strong>ZEEW</strong> does not give warranties or guarantees that ZEEW Tokens are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each Participant of ZEEW Tokens shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of ZEEW Tokens being considered a security in their respective jurisdiction.<br />
                <br />
                Every Participant is bound to check if acquisition and disposal of ZEEW Tokens is legal in its jurisdiction, and by accepting these Terms each Participant undertakes not to use ZEEW Tokens should their use not be legal in the relevant jurisdiction. If a Participant establishes that the use of ZEEW Tokens under these Terms is not legal in its jurisdiction, it shall neither use the ZEEW Tokens nor acquire them, and should immediately stop using or possessing them if such case arises.<br />
                <br />
                Acquiring cryptographic tokens in possession and exchanging them for other cryptographic tokens will most likely continue to be scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world, which have so far given mixed reactions and opinions depending on the jurisdiction. The legal ability of <strong>ZEEW</strong> to provide ZEEW tokens in some jurisdictions may be hindered or eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it turns out with a high degree of certainty that ZEEW Tokens are not legal in certain jurisdiction, <strong>ZEEW</strong> will either:</p>

            <p style="margin-left:80px">1) cease operations in that jurisdiction, or</p>

            <p style="margin-left:80px">2) adjust ZEEW Tokens and in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">b) Risks associated with Ethereum<br />
                <br />
                ZEEW Tokens are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the ZEEW Tokens to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum may itself lose value and hence impact the value ZEEW Tokens. Other unforeseeable changes in Ethereum, whether intended or not, may likewise impact the value and usability of ZEEW Tokens. More information about Ethereum is available at https://www.ethereum.org</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">c) Risk of unfavorable regulatory action in one or more jurisdictions<br />
                <br />
                Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Ethereum network and associated blockchain networks and crypto currencies and ZEEW Tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like ZEEW Tokens, which could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of their use and possession, and their value.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">d) Risk of theft and hacking<br />
                <br />
                Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with your Third-party Wallet, the Website, Ethereum Network or the availability of ZEEW<br />
                <br />
                Tokens and crypto currency in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">e) Risk of security weaknesses in the Website and ZEEW Tokens source code or any associated software and/or infrastructure<br />
                <br />
                There is a risk that the Website and ZEEW Tokens may unintentionally include weaknesses or bugs in the source code interfering with the use of or causing the loss of ZEEW Tokens.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">f) Risk of weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography<br />
                <br />
                Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to crypto currencies, Ethereum, ZEEW tokens, which could result in the theft or loss of ZEEW Tokens.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">g) Risk of mining attacks<br />
                <br />
                As with other decentralized crypto currencies, the Ethereum blockchain, which is used for the ZEEW Tokens, is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the ZEEW Tokens, expected proper execution and sequencing of ZEEW Tokens, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum smart contract computations in general. Despite the best efforts of <strong>ZEEW</strong> and Ethereum Foundation, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Mining Attacks, as described above, may also target other blockchain networks, with which the ZEEW Tokens interact with and consequently the ZEEW Tokens may be impacted also in that way to the extent described above.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">h) Risk of low or no liquidity<br />
                <br />
                Even though there are currently online service available which enable possibility of exchange of cryptographic tokens with other such tokens or even enable the exchange of cryptographic tokens for fiat money, there are no warranties and/or guarantees given that ZEEW Tokens will be listed or made available for exchange with other cryptographic tokens and/or fiat money, and no guarantees are given whatsoever with the capacity (volume) of such potential exchange. It shall be explicitly cautioned, that such exchange, if any, might be subject to poorly-understood regulatory oversight, and <strong>ZEEW</strong> does not give any warranties in regard to any exchange services providers. Participants might be exposed to fraud and failure. In any case, <strong>ZEEW</strong> will not enable exchange of ZEEW Tokens for other cryptographic tokens or for fiat currency, although it will commit reasonable endeavors to list ZEEW Tokens on such exchange(s).</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">i) Risk of loss of value<br />
                <br />
                Value of ZEEW Tokens may fluctuate and their Participants might suffer loss in value of such acquired tokens. There might be various reasons that would cause unfavorable fluctuations of the value of the ZEEW tokens.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">k) Risk of malfunction in the Ethereum network or any other blockchain<br />
                <br />
                It is possible that the Ethereum network or any other network, to which the ZEEW Tokens are interacting with, malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including but not limited to one that results in the loss of ZEEW Tokens.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">l) Internet transmission risks<br />
                <br />

            <p style="margin-left:40px">m) Unanticipated risks<br />
                <br />
                Crypto currencies and blockchains are new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks that <strong>ZEEW</strong> cannot foresee and it is unreasonable to believe that such risks could have been foreseeable. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">n) ZEEW and <strong>ZEEW</strong> project, as developed may not meet your expectations<br />
                <br />
                <strong>ZEEW</strong> project is currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Your expectations regarding the form and functionality of project and ZEEW tokens may not be met upon deployment of the project, additional products and services for any number of reasons, including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of ZEEW Tokens. <strong>ZEEW</strong> does not offer any guarantee as to the marketability or expected use of the ZEEW tokens.</p>

            <p style="margin-left:40px">o) The Project may never be completed or released<br />
                <br />
                The project, described in section 3, may never be released and operational, even though <strong>ZEEW</strong> will make reasonable efforts to complete and deploy it.</p>

            <p>6.3. The ZEEW tokens are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;. We and our affiliates and licensors make no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise regarding the ZEEW Tokens, including any warranty that the ZEEW Tokens will be uninterrupted, error-free or free of harmful components, secure or not otherwise lost or damaged. Except to the extent prohibited by law, we and our affiliates and licensors disclaim all warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non- infringement, or quiet enjoyment, and any warranties arising out of any course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>
